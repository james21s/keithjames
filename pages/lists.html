				<h2>Calle Crisologo, Vigan</h2>
				<p>Though only 500 meters long, Calle Crisologo in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, is one of the most beautiful streets in the Philippines. It boasts centuries-old stone houses, lovely tungsten lamps, and antique cobblestone, where horse-drawn carriages or kalesas are still used for transport. In fact, the street is a pedestrian-only zone, save for kalesas favored for touring the historical sites around town.

				<h2>Nacpan Beach, El Nido</h2>
				<p>El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride away through a land tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach. 
				Island hopping escapades in El Nido including a visit to El Nido Big Lagoon and other top Palawan beaches should not be missed. But after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beaches in El Nido, limestone cliffs, and other El Nido Palawan tourist spots a trip to relaxing Nacpan Beach is highly recommended and deserves a spot in your itinerary. The main attraction is its 4-kilometer shoreline with golden sand and endless palm trees lining up, perfect for just bumming around. Calitang Beach sits on the other side, and the two beaches form what is now popularly known as the Twin Beaches of El Nido.
				Visitors are not advised to swim far away from shore in Nacpan as currents tend to become strong and rough with little warning.</p>
